# Analysis of data related job listings in Australia

## Introduction

Data Science in Australia is a nebulous term (even more so than elsewhere in the world). It can cover wide ranging job titles such as:

- Analyst
- Data Analyst
- Business Analyst
- Business Intelligence Analyst
- Data Scientist
- Data Engineer
- Machine Learning Engineer

These jobs (in theory) each focus on some parts of the data science pipeline more than others. But it's not always the case that job title perfectly maps to parts of the pipeline. This presented several problems:

1. __Looking at listings was draining due to the noise:__ I couldn't tell from a glance at the job title if I satisfied the requirements for the job or not.
2. __Techniques and technologies even vary inside a job title:__ Two 'Data Scientist' jobs might have wildly different requirements. 
    - Do they use R, Python, or SQL? All 3?
    - SAS and other statistical languages?
    - A/B Testing? 
    - Regression? Linear or Logistic?
    - Clustering? K-Means or K-Nearest Neighbors?
    - Machine Learning? Supervised or Unsupervised?
    - Neural Nets?
    - Dashboard tools? Tablau or Power BI?
    - Cloud? Google or AWS?

This caused a kind of analysis paralysis. I didn't know where to focus my energy as I certainly couldn't demonstrate mastery in all of these areas. This lead me to the question.

## Question

What techniques and technologies commonly appear together in data related job listings?
